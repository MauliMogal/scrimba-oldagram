# 📸 Instagram Clone (Oldagram)

This project was completed as part of the **Essential CSS** module in [The Scrimba Fullstack Developer Path](https://scrimba.com/fullstack-path-c0fullstack).

## 📌 Project Overview

Oldagram is a simple static clone of an Instagram-style post. The focus was on writing clean, semantic HTML and applying modern CSS styling — including layout, spacing, and hover effects.

This was a **solo project**, aimed at reinforcing real-world CSS workflows and semantic HTML best practices.

---

## 🎯 Requirements

- Create the first post based on the design mockup
- Use **semantic HTML** structure
- Add **hover effects** to interactive icons

---

## 🚀 Stretch Goals (Optional Enhancements)

These were not required but recommended for going above and beyond:

- [ ] Use JavaScript to render all three posts dynamically
- [ ] Increase likes when **double-clicking** the post image

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- *(Optional)* JavaScript (for stretch goals)

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

- Writing semantic and accessible HTML
- CSS layout and spacing (margin, padding, flexbox)
- Responsive design basics
- Icon styling and hover interactions
- Conditional rendering (if stretch goals completed)
